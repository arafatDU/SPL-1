### Project Title:  Compression & Decompression Utility

#### Project Description:
The purpose of this project is to build a utility that can compress and decompress files using 
various  algorithms  like  Huffman coding algorithm,  LZ77 algorithm, Burrows-Wheeler 
Transformation algorithm. The  project  will  compare  the  effectiveness (e.g., File size, 
Compression ratio) of these compression algorithms.
#### Project Goals:
##### •        Efficiently reduce file sizes for storage and transmission.
##### •        Implement multiple compression algorithms for comparison.
##### •        Build an intuitive user interface for ease of use.
